# 🐮 Cow Debugger — Learn and Visualize Cow Step by Step

This project is a simple, interactive **debugger** written in Python for the esoteric language **Cow**.  
It allows you to execute Cow code step by step, while visualizing:

- 📦 The memory (cells)
- 🎯 The pointer position
- 📋 The clipboard (`MMM`)
- 🖨️ The output generated

---

## 🚧 Status: Debugger in development

The debugger is currently being built from scratch as a learning tool.  
It’s designed to help beginners understand Cow’s internals and how it operates like a Turing machine.

---

## 🧠 Perfect for:
- Learning Cow from zero
- Teaching esoteric programming
- Understanding memory and instruction flow

---

## 📁 Project contents

- `hello_world.cow` → A basic Cow program that prints `"HELLO WORLD"`
- `debugger_cow.py` → A TODO-based Python debugger you’re building step by step
- `README.md` → Project documentation

---

## 🧩 Planned features:
- Support for loops (`MOO ... moo`)
- Code execution from memory (`mOO`)
- GUI debugger (Tkinter or curses)
- Reverse stepping (execution history)

---

## ✅ Quick Description (for repo):

> A step-by-step Cow language debugger written in Python. Learn how Cow works by building your own interpreter. *(Work in progress)*
